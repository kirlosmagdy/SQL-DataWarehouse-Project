🚀 Modern Data Warehouse & Analytics SolutionEnd-to-End Data Engineering Portfolio: From Raw Data to Actionable Insights📌 Project OverviewThis project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing solution designed to transform fragmented raw data from ERP and CRM systems into a structured, high-performance analytical engine. By implementing the Medallion Architecture, this solution ensures data quality and provides a "Single Source of Truth" for business intelligence.The Goal: Empower stakeholders with deep insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends through a scalable and robust data pipeline.🏗️ Data ArchitectureThe project leverages a modern Medallion Architecture to maintain a clean, traceable, and reliable data flow from source to consumption.Figure 1: Full Data Architecture Overview🥉 Bronze Layer (Raw)Source: Data is ingested as-is from CRM and ERP source systems provided as CSV files.Loading: Utilizes batch processing via a Full Load (Truncate & Insert) strategy managed by stored procedures.Purpose: Maintains the original state of data for auditability and historical reference.🥈 Silver Layer (Cleaned)Process: Performs data cleansing, standardization, and normalization.Transformations: Includes handling null values, correcting data types, and data enrichment.Purpose: Provides a reliable foundation of high-quality data for cross-departmental analysis.🥇 Gold Layer (Analytical)Structure: Houses business-ready data modeled into a high-performance Star Schema.Implementation: Utilizes SQL Views to perform data integrations, aggregations, and apply business logic.Purpose: Optimized for reporting, ad-hoc SQL queries, and machine learning applications.🔗 Data Integration & FlowThe pipeline integrates transactional records and customer information from two distinct sources to create a unified view of the business.Figure 2: Integration between CRM and ERP source systemsThe following diagram illustrates the specific movement of table objects through the Medallion layers:Figure 3: Object-level Data Flow through Bronze, Silver, and Gold📊 Data Modeling (Star Schema)To optimize query performance and usability, the Gold Layer is organized into a Star Schema consisting of centralized fact tables and descriptive dimension tables.Figure 4: Dimensional Data ModelFact Table: gold.fact_sales captures all transactional data, including the core sales calculation:$$Sales = Quantity \times price$$Dimension Tables: gold.dim_customers and gold.dim_products provide descriptive attributes (e.g., demographics, categories, and maintenance status) to enable multi-dimensional analysis.💡 Analytics & Business InsightsThe "Gold" data provides the foundation for advanced SQL-based reporting:Customer Behavior: Insights into demographics, marital status, and geographic distribution.Product Performance: Analysis of top-performing categories, subcategories, and product lines.Sales Trends: Strategic tracking of revenue and quantity metrics over time.🛠️ Tech Stack & ToolsDatabase: Microsoft SQL Server ExpressManagement: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)Modeling/Diagramming: Draw.ioVersion Control: Git & GitHubDocumentation: Notion & Markdown📂 Repository StructureBash├── datasets/           # Raw ERP & CRM CSV files

🚀 How to Get StartedClone the Repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/kirlosmagdy/SQL-DataWarehouse-Project.git
Environment Setup: Ensure you have SQL Server and SSMS installed.Execute Scripts: Run the SQL scripts in the following order: Bronze ➔ Silver ➔ Gold.Explore Data: Use the provided analytical queries in the Gold directory to generate insights.🤝 AcknowledgmentsSpecial thanks to Baraa Khatib Salkini (Data With Baraa) for providing the foundational guidance and project roadmap that inspired this implementation.📬 Let's Connect!Kirlos Magdy LinkedIn | GitHubWould you like me to help you draft the data_catalog.md file to further define the specific columns and data types shown in your model?
